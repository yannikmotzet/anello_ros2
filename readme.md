# ANELLO ROS Driver

## ANELLO Products Supported

The ANELLO ROS driver supports the ANELLO EVK, GNSS INS, and IMU+ running firmware versions >= v1.1.1.

## ANELLO ROS Driver Installation

### Install ROS

Follow the instructions on the [ROS2 Wiki](https://docs.ros.org/) to install ROS2 on your system.

### Install ANELLO ROS Driver

Clone this repository into your ROS2 workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Anello-Photonics/ANELLO_ROS_Driver.git
```

## ANELLO ROS Driver Configuration

### Serial Communications

The ANELLO ROS driver defaults serial communications baud rate to 230400.
If you are using the ANELLO EVK or have changed the baud rate in the GNSS INS or IMU+, you will need to update the ```BAUDRATE``` in "anello_ros_driver/anello_node/src/anello_ros_driver/comm/serial_interface.h".

```c++
#ifndef BAUDRATE
#define BAUDRATE B230400    //Default baudrate for ANELLO GNSS INS and IMU+
// #define BAUDRATE B921600    //Default baudrate for ANELLO EVK
#endif
```

To set up serial communications:

1. Ensure that the ```anello_com_type``` arg is set to ```UART```.
2. Leave the UART port name configurations on ```AUTO``` to use the automatic connection procedure, or manually set the path (```/dev/ttyUSB0```).

Launch file sample:

```xml
    <!-- Set the COM_TYPE to UART or ETH -->
    <arg name="anello_com_type" default="UART"/>

    <!-- Uart port names -->
    <arg name="anello_uart_data_port" default="AUTO"/>
    <arg name="anello_uart_config_port" default="AUTO"/>
```

### Ethernet Communications

To set up ethernet communications:

1. Ensure that the ```anello_com_type``` arg is set to ```ETH```.
2. Set the IP address of the ANELLO device in the ```anello_remote_ip``` arg.
3. Ensure that the IP address of the system running the ROS driver is set in the ANELLO unit's "Computer IP" configuration.
4. Set the data port, config port, and odometer port in the launch file. Ensure these match the ANELLO unit configuration.

Launch file sample:

```xml
    <!-- Set the COM_TYPE to UART or ETH -->
    <arg name="anello_com_type" default="ETH"/>
```

```xml
    <!-- Ethernet port names -->
    <arg name="anello_remote_ip" default="192.168.1.111"/>
    <arg name="anello_local_data_port" default="1111"/>
    <arg name="anello_local_config_port" default="2222"/>
    <arg name="anello_local_odometer_port" default="3333"/>
```

### Setting Up NTRIP client

Update the NTRIP client parameters in the launch file to point to your NTRIP caster:

```xml
    <!-- NTRIP CLIENT PARAMTERS -->
    <arg name="host" value="127.0.0.1"/>
    <arg name="port" value="1111"/>
    <arg name="mountpoint" value="AUTO"/>
    <arg name="authenticate" value="true"/>
    <arg name="username" value=""/>
    <arg name="password" value=""/>
    <arg name="ntrip_version" value=""/>
    <arg name="ssl" value="false"/>
    <arg name="cert" value=""/>
    <arg name="key" value=""/>
    <arg name="ca_cert" value=""/>
    <arg name="debug" value="false"/>
    <arg name="rtcm_message_package" value="mavros_msgs"/>
```

### Build Code

Make sure the ROS environment is sourced and build the code via colcon:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
```

## ANELLO ROS Driver Usage

### Launch ANELLO ROS Driver

```bash
ros2 launch anello_ros_driver anello_ros_driver_launch.xml
```

ANELLO messages will be published to topics (see below). For information on how to view these messages, see the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics).

### Importing ANELLO Messages

All ANELLO ROS2 messages are defined under the ```anello_interfaces``` package, so this is the package that needs to be included.

```c++
#include "anello_interfaces/msg/apimu.hpp"
```

```python
from anello_interfaces.msg import APIMU
```

### Topics

#### Published Topics

Topic definitions are defined in the [ANELLO Developer Manual](https://docs-a1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by the ASCII message format. Custom message definitions are used for ANELLO messages and can be found in the `/anello_ros_driver/anello_interfaces/msg` directory. Messages are defined within the anello_interfaces package.

* `/APIMU`
* `/APIM1`
* `/APINS`
* `/APGPS`
* `/APGP2`
* `/APHDG`
* `/APHEALTH`
  * Message Definitions:
    * `position_acc_flag`
      * 0 = Centimeter-level accuracy
      * 1 = Meter-level accuracy
      * 2 = Poor GPS accuracy (> 1m)
    * `heading_health_flag`
      * 0 = Heading stability confirmed (GPS and INS headings match)
      * 1 = Unable to confirm heading stability (may be due to poor GPS signal or driving too slow to get reliable GPS heading)
    * `gyro_health_flag`
      * 0 = Rate sensor stable
      * 1 = Rate sensor unstable (large discrepancy between optical and MEMS gyros)
* `/ntrip_client/nmea`

In addition to the ANELLO-specific topics above, the same data is also published as standard ROS messages so it can be consumed by common packages (e.g. `robot_localization`) without depending on `anello_interfaces`:

* `/imu/data_raw` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`) - raw gyro/accelerometer from `APIMU`/`APIM1`, no orientation
* `/imu/data` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`) - orientation only, from `APINS` roll/pitch/heading
* `/gps/fix` (`sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`) - from `APGPS`
* `/gps2/fix` (`sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`) - from `APGP2`
* `/odom` (`nav_msgs/Odometry`) - from `APINS`; position is a local ENU tangent-plane approximation anchored to the first INS fix received (not tied to a global datum)
* `/tf` (`map_frame_id` -> `base_frame_id`) - broadcast alongside `/odom`, controlled by the `publish_tf` launch argument (default `true`)

ANELLO reports orientation/velocity in NED (nav frame) and FRD (body frame); these are converted to ROS's ENU/FLU (REP-103) convention. Frame IDs default to `imu_link`, `gps_link`, `gps2_link`, `map`, and `base_link`, and can be overridden via the `imu_frame_id`, `gps_frame_id`, `gps2_frame_id`, `map_frame_id`, and `base_frame_id` launch arguments.

**Why `/odom` defaults to frame_id `map`, not `odom`:** per [REP-105](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html), `odom` is expected to be locally continuous (no jumps, only slow drift), which is normally what dead-reckoning sensors (wheel/visual odometry) provide. `/odom` here is derived from `APINS`, which already applies GPS/RTK corrections, so it *can* jump when the RTK status changes (e.g. float -> fixed) or after a GNSS reacquisition -- that matches REP-105's definition of the `map` frame instead. If you build a localization stack (e.g. `robot_localization`) with its own dead-reckoning-based `odom` -> `base_link`, this can still feed it as the `map` -> `odom` correction.

If you plan to fuse this data with `robot_localization` or another node that also broadcasts the `odom` -> `base_link` transform, set `publish_tf:=false` to avoid two nodes publishing the same transform.

#### Subscribed Topics

Use the custom message and topic below to send odometer speed to the ANELLO unit.

* `/APODO`
  * Use the custom message definition found in `/anello_ros_driver/msg/APODO.msg`
* `/ntrip_client/rtcm_msg`
